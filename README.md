## Presentation

Cytomine-js-client is an opensource javascript client allowing to communicate with the REST API of a Cytomine instance. For more information about Cytomine, go to https://www.cytomine.org.
See installation instructions here : https://doc.cytomine.org/dev-guide/clients/javascript/installation

## How to use the client

The javascript client can be used in one of the following ways:
* As an NPM module for a browser application (install with `npm install cytomine-client`);
* With a direct `<script>` include.

In any case, the client should be used in a browser environment, since it relies on cookies for authentication.

#### Sample code
```javascript
import {Cytomine, User, ProjectCollection} from "cytomine-client"; // required only if used as an NPM module

// Initialize connection (replace CYTOMINE_URL by an appropriate value, e.g. "http://demo.cytomine.coop")
let cytomine = new Cytomine(CYTOMINE_URL);

// Login into Cytomine
await cytomine.login("username", "password"); // or await Cytomine.instance.login("username", "password");

// Fetch the connected user, and log "Hello " followed by its username in the console
let user = await User.fetchCurrent();
console.log("Hello " + user.username);

// Fetch the projects available to the current user and log their names in the console
let projects = await ProjectCollection.fetchAll();
console.log("You have access to these projects:");
for(let project of projects) {
    console.log(project.name);
}
```

## Development

#### Installation
First checkout the repository, then install the dependencies with

    npm install

 #### Test execution

Prior to the first test execution, update the [tests configuration file](tests/config.js) with appropriate values (**beware that the tests will create data on the configured Cytomine instance!**). To avoid committing the configuration values, it is advised to run `git update-index --skip-worktree tests/config.js`.

Then, to execute the tests, run

    npm run test

Note that the execution of the tests requires Mozilla Firefox browser. Moreover, the Cytomine instance used for the tests must allow CORS.

#### Build for production with minification
    npm run build
Generates a minified file located in dist folder, which can be included with `<script>`

#### Create a tarball
    npm pack
The tarball can then be installed in another npm project with

    npm install PATH_TO_TARBALL
